# Kobalt

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-Apache%202.0-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

> **Kobalt** is a lightweight Kotlin wrapper for [JDA](https://github.com/discord-jda/JDA) that simplifies Discord bot
> development with an idiomatic Kotlin DSL.

---

> **Note: Kobalt is still in its early stages, and there are a few things to keep in mind**:
>
> * Kobalt is **not yet available on Maven Central** â€“ please follow the [Installation](#Installation) instructions to
    get started.
> * **Documentation is currently missing**, but it's on the roadmap.
> * **JDA API support is not complete yet.** I'm actively working on it, but since this is still a **solo project**,
    progress can be a bit slow. I'm planning to build a team in the future to help move things along.

   ```

## Usage

Import and initialize `KBot`, register command groups, then start your bot.

### Example Bot

```kt
class MyGroup(val bot: KBot) : CommandGroup(bot) {
    @Command(name = "hi")
    fun sayHi(event: MessageReceivedEvent) {
        event.channel.sendMessage("Hello!").queue()
    }
    
    @SlashCommand(name = "ping")
    fun ping(event: SlashCommandInteractionEvent) {
        event.reply("Pong! (${event.jda.gatewayPing}ms)").queue()
    }
}

fun main() {
    val intents = arrayOf(
        GatewayIntent.GUILD_MEMBERS,
        GatewayIntent.MESSAGE_CONTENT,
        GatewayIntent.GUILD_MESSAGES,
        GatewayIntent.GUILD_MESSAGE_REACTIONS,
    )
    val bot = KBot(
        token = "YOUR_TOKEN",
        intents = intents,
        prefix = "!",
        botTimeZone = "UTC",
        onReady = { bot ->
            bot.logger.info { "${bot.management.selfUser.name} is ready!" }
        }
    )
    bot.registerCommands(MyGroup(bot))
    bot.ownerID = "YOUR_ID"
    bot.startBot()
}
```

Replace `YOUR_TOKEN` and `YOUR_ID` with your actual bot token and discord account ID, and adjust the prefix as desired.
